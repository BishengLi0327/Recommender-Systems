A motivating example of our proposed framework. An e-commerce platform user, Emma, has multiple interests including jewelry, handbags, and make-ups. Our multi-interest extraction module can capture these three interests from her click sequence. Each interest retrieves items from the large-scale item pool based on the interest embedding independently. An aggregation module combines items from different interests and outputs the overall top-N recommended items for Emma
