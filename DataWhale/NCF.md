##### *2017 International World Wide Web Conference*

**Main Contribution**: 
1. This paper presents a neural network architecture to model latent features of users and items and devise a general framework NCF for collaborative filtering based
on neural networks.
2. This paper shows that MF can be interpreted as a specialization of NCF and utilize a multi-layer perceptron to endow NCF modelling with a high level of non-linearities.

**NCF Framework**:
