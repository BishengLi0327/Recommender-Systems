**Main Contribution**:
1. This paper applies recurrent neural networks on recommender systems domain. By modeling the session-based data, more accurate recommendations can be provided.
2. The approach also considers practical aspects of the task and introduces several modifications to the classific RNNs that make it viable for the specific problem.
3. Experiments results on two datasets show marked improvements over widely used approaches.
